# Spotify Clone using React

## Tech Stack
This project is a clone of the Spotify application done with the help of React. Tailwind CSS has been used in order to provide styling.

### Unique Features
This app allows users to play the song of their choice and also navigate between songs. It also allows users to navigate through playlists of different genres.

### Steps to Run:
1. The React app can be created using the command: npx create-react-app <app_name> after the required packages have been installed.
2. In order to start the app, you need to run the command: npm start.

Please note that this app is purely based on front end development and no backend or database has been utilised for the same. All the images and songs have been obtained from the assets folder present inside the src folder. One can include songs of their choice in the application by just adding newer entries into the assets folder and updating the details in the albumsData and songsData lists in the /src/assets.js file.
